pseudo code:
FUNCTION mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    INITIALIZE result as empty string
    INITIALIZE i = 0

    WHILE i is less than length of word1 OR i is less than length of word2:
        
        IF i is less than length of word1:
            APPEND character at index i of word1 to result
        
        IF i is less than length of word2:
            APPEND character at index i of word2 to result

        INCREMENT i by 1

    RETURN result
